# Etch-A-Sketchpad

In this project I was able to utilize my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQueary. The project was to build a functioning online etch-a-sketch that when I hover over the sketch-pad with my mouse I was able to draw a picture. There is also a button with a prompt that lets you choose how big you want the sketch-pad to be and erases the previous sketch-pad. 

This was part of the online curriculum for The Odin Project course.
